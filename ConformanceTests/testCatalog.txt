Install-Arc-Agents: 

This test will be responsible for installing the arc-agents onto the kubernetes cluster.
It will take in the parameters required for helm onboarding, pull the helm charts and install them onto the cluster.
This will be a spn based onboarding. 

 

Check-pod-status: 

This test will check the status of all the pods in the azure-arc namespace and ensure that all the pod containers 
are in ‘Running’ state (without any restarts) and fail otherwise mentioning the pod name that caused failure. 

 

Check-Identity-Operator: 

This test will first check if the crd instance ‘config-agent-identity-request’ is created. Then it will check 
if the secrets ‘azure-identity-certificate’ and ‘config-agent-identity-request-token’ are present.
This will ensure that MSI is working e2e. 

 

Check-Connected-Cluster: 

This test will ensure that the secret ‘azure-arc-connect-privatekey’ is present and get the connected cluster resource from ARM.
It will fail if the connected cluster was not found or was found and did not have its provisioning state as ‘Succeeded’.
